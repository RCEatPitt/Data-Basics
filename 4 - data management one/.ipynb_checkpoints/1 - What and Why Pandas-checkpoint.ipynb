    "\n",
    "* Pandas is a 3rd-party library for doing data analysis\n",
    "* It is a foundational component of Python data science\n",
    "* Developed by [Wes McKinney](http://wesmckinney.com/pages/about.html) while working in the finance industry, so it has some...warts\n",
    "* Vanilla Python (what we did previously) can do many of the same things, but Pandas does them *faster* and usually in fewer lines of code\n",
    "* To do this, is built on top of another 3rd party library called [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "    * If you have TONS of numerical data you can use Numpy directly\n",
    "* Pandas gives Python some R like functionality (Dataframes)"

    "## Why Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas provides a powerful set of data structure and functions for working with data.\n",
    "* Once you learn these structures and functions (which takes time) you can begin to quickly ask questions and get answers from data.\n",
    "* Pandas integrates nicely with other libraries in the Python data science ecosysem like:\n",
    "    * [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) - pretty display of Dataframes as HTML tables\n",
    "    * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Easy plotting from Dataframes\n",
    "    * [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Integrates with the machine learning api\n",

This isn't the plain old filter function, this is a special filter fuction (part of the groupby functionality) that requires you to create a special function to apply to each row.
