    "## Setup and SQLite\n",
    "---\n",
    "For this lesson you will need your UNIX shell (open one up with the + button in the upper left hand corner of this page and select the terminal), plus SQLite3 and the database file we'll be using: survey.db. We already have all of these things, but when you start to do this by yourself, you'll have to make sure that your machine is situated correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relational database** is a way to store and manipulate information. Databases are arranged as **tables**. Each table has columns (also known as **fields**) that describe the data, and rows (also known as **records**) which contain the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are using a spreadsheet, we put formulas into cells to calculate new values based on old ones. When we are using a database, we send commands (usually called **queries**) to a **database manager**: a program that manipulates the database for us. The database manager does whatever lookups and calculations the query specifies, returning the results in a tabular form that we can then use as a starting point for further queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changing Database Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "Every database manager — Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Access, and SQLite — stores data in a different way, so a database created with one cannot be used directly by another. However, every database manager can import and export data in a variety of formats, like .csv, so it is possible to move information from one to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries are written in a language called **SQL**, which stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL provides hundreds of different ways to analyze and recombine data. We will only look at a handful of queries, but that handful accounts for most of what scientists do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Into and Out of SQLite\n",
