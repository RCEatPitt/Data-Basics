    "\n",
    "These are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer: `pwd`, `ls` and `cd`. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have some additional functinality.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if you type `cd` on its own, without giving a directory?  \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer!  \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "/ihome/mburton/mcburton\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory, which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories to move to `data` in one step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd data-basics-fall-2019/data-shell/data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above), we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash. The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to move to our `data-shell` directory from anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside `data`). To find the absolute path we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need to move to `data-shell`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "/ihome/mburton/mcburton/data-basics-fall-2019/data-shell/data\n",
