    "The `*` symbol is a **wildcard pattern**. It matches zero or more characters, so `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "/ihome/mburton/mcburton/data-basics-spring-2018-one/data-shell/data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls *.txt\n",
    "amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  morse.txt  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`?` is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This means that `p?.pdb` would match files with names like `pi.pdb` or `p5.pdb` , but not `propane.pdb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, `p*.p?*` matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at least one more character (since the `?` has to match one character, and the final `*` can match any number of characters). Thus, `p*.p?*` would match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames *before* running the command specified. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the `molecules` directory (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally commands like `ls` see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design."
