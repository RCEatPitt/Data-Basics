    "* Create and use a repository\n",

    "* GitHub is a commercial service (now owned by Microsoft) for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on Git repositories\n",
    "* You don't need to use GitHub to use Git, they are separate things, but GitHub makes using Git much easier because it provides a central location on the web for uploading your Git repositories\n",

    "## Step 1. Create and Checkout a Repository\n",
    "A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a *README*, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a *license file*.\n",
